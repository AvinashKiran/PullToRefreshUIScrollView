Inspired by and some code taken from [PullToRefresh](https://github.com/leah/PullToRefresh/)

How to install

1. Copy the files, [PullToRefreshScrollView.h](https://github.com/joshgrenon/PullToRefreshUIScrollView/raw/master/Classes/PullToRefreshScrollView.h),
[PullToRefreshScrollView.m](https://github.com/joshgrenon/PullToRefreshUIScrollView/raw/master/Classes/PullToRefreshScrollView.m),
